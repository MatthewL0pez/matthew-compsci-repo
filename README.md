# My Thoughs

I think im feeling alright today. Though as of doing this assignment right now, I am still pretty angry I forgot my water bottle in one of my classes after realizing I left it behind getting to my car. Sour mood and something I could have circumvent but it is what it is. Besides that I think everything is going pretty alright and I hope to learn and achieve a lot in this class. 

1/27/2026 - I got the water bottle back :)
